    desc: " In this study, we have proposed an Agent Based Model (ABM) of residential location choice. The model takes social-economic information of households and the development suitability as input data. The household-level information is interpolated with census and annual health survey data using Iterative proportion fitting. The development suitability is generated by regression of development affecting parameters such as Road network, Water supply, Amenities, and Land Rates. ",

    desc: " In this study, we have tried to predict the flood occurrence in Mumbai using various machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting methods. Historical flooding events and the value of flood contributing factors are used as inputs for the model. Our model can be used for the prediction of the locations where the chances of flood occurrence are highly likely and can accordingly plan for flood mitigation and relief measures.",
