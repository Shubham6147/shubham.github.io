excerpt: 'Urban settlement patterns are shaped by human decision-making during land development. This study proposes an Agent-Based Model (ABM) for residential location choice, integrating socioeconomic data and development suitability factors such as road networks, water supply, amenities, and land rates. Household data is interpolated using census and health survey records, while development suitability is modeled through regression analysis. Simulating residential choices from 2003 to 2019, the model achieved 60% accuracy with Random Forest regression and 53% with Logistic Regression. Findings reveal a socioeconomic divide in urban residential patterns, influenced by the distribution of amenities and services.'
