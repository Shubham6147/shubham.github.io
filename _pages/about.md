## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Stirling, focusing on leveraging technologies like remote sensing and machine learning to better understand poverty and inequality in the UK. My academic foundation is in Urban Planning and Geoinformatics, complemented by over three years of professional experience in the geospatial industry, where I applied technology to spatial analysis challenges.

## Academic Journey

My research interests lie at the intersection of geospatial technology and socioeconomic development. Over the years, I have undertaken projects that examine urban infrastructure, population distribution, and economic disparities:

- **Undergraduate Research:** Conducted an impact analysis of transit-oriented development policies along a metro corridor, assessing population influx and its implications for urban infrastructure and quality of life.
- **Masterâ€™s Research:** Investigated how household income influences residential location choices and urban morphology using agent-based modeling.

## Professional Experience

I have worked on several impactful projects in the geospatial industry, including:

- **GIS Data Engineer at Vassar Labs:**
  
  - Specialising in building data pipelines for geospatial applications.

- **GIS Data Engineer at Kawa Space:**
  
  - Specializing in building data pipelines for geospatial applications

- **Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Bengaluru:**

  - Developed a large-scale data processing platform using Open Data Cube framework as part of India Data Cube (IDC) Project (AWS GEO Grant).
  - Built deep learning models (CNNs) to estimate built-up areas from satellite imagery.
  - Developed geospatial metadata standards for institue level spatial data portal.
  - Designed and implemented an online survey application using ODK.
  - Contributed to web GIS portal development


## Research Focus

My work revolves around utilizing remote sensing data for social good, with an emphasis on machine learning applications in urban analytics. I am deeply committed to open-source initiatives, contributing to educational blogs and community-driven projects.
