# Biography

## Introduction

I am a Ph.D. researcher at the University of Stirling, focusing on leveraging technologies like remote sensing and machine learning to better understand poverty and inequality in the UK. My academic foundation is in Urban Planning and Geoinformatics, complemented by over three years of professional experience in the geospatial industry, where I applied technology to spatial analysis challenges.

## Academic Journey

My research interests lie at the intersection of geospatial technology and socioeconomic development. Over the years, I have undertaken projects that examine urban infrastructure, population distribution, and economic disparities:

- **Undergraduate Research:** Conducted an impact analysis of transit-oriented development policies along a metro corridor, assessing population influx and its implications for urban infrastructure and quality of life.
- **Masterâ€™s Research:** Investigated how household income influences residential location choices and urban morphology using agent-based modeling.

## Professional Experience

I have worked on several impactful projects in the geospatial industry, including:

- **Intern at Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Bengaluru:**
  - Developed geospatial metadata standards
  - Designed and implemented an online survey application
  - Contributed to web GIS portal development
- **India Data Cube (IDC) Project (AWS GEO Grant):**
  - Developed a large-scale data processing platform using Open Data Cube framework
  - Built deep learning models (CNNs) to estimate built-up areas from satellite imagery
- **GIS Data Engineer at Vassar Labs:**
  - Specializing in building data pipelines for geospatial applications

## Research Focus

My work revolves around utilizing remote sensing data for social good, with an emphasis on machine learning applications in urban analytics. I am deeply committed to open-source initiatives, contributing to educational blogs and community-driven projects.
